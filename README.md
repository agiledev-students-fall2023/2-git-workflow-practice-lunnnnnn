This articles compares flask and django, two power python development frameworks.
They are both powerful and scalable. Django is faster and portable, while flask is more lightweight and secured with integrated unit testing
I think it's interesting how different frameworks can be super helpful in development framework

## Comment from Siyu Bi
I think for agile development, Django is more suitable since it's smaller and more flexible, while using flask might require a more rigid plan of software structure.
