This articles compares flask and django, two power python development frameworks.
They are both powerful and scalable. Django is faster and portable, while flask is more lightweight and secured with integrated unit testing
I think it's interesting how different frameworks can be super helpful in development framework

## Comment from Siyu Bi
I think for agile development, Django is more suitable since it's smaller and more flexible, while using flask might require a more rigid plan of software structure.

Here are more details fo the comparision between Django and Flask: 

 - Django: It is a robust and feature-rich framework suitable for building complex applications. While it has a steeper learning curve, it excels in handling sophisticated projects.

 - Flask: This lightweight framework offers flexibility and is ideal for small projects and experimentation. It provides developers with full control over the development process.

Thus, learning both Flask and Django can be valuable for your career, as they are in high demand in the industry. Ultimately, the choice between the two should be based on the project's complexity and your expertise.
